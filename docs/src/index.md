# NURBS.jl

`NURBS.jl` (or `Non Uniform Rational B-Spline Surfaces`) is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) library to build parametrical curves and parametrical surface based on the interpolation of polynomial bases.

In this documentation it is explained a little brief of theory and how to apply it in computer science.


## Dependencies

`NURBS.jl` has no dependencies but is build to work with:

 - [Plasm](https://github.com/cvdlab/Plasm.jl)
 - [Linear Algebraic Representation](https://github.com/cvdlab/LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.jl)


## Docstrings conventions

 - **Bold** is used to point out theory concepts.
 - `Monospace` is used for everything code related.
